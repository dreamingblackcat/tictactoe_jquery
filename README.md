tictactoe_jquery
================

A tictactoe game with jquery and bootstrap.

This is a toy project in which I (dreamingblackcat) try to create a simple tictactoe game using jquery,javascript and html.
I use bootstrap for fast ui prototyping.

To play it:
-open the index.html file in the browser.
-click start button . The game panel will slide down.Click on one of the nine blue boxes to play.
-for now,the game is to be played in turn.
-I might add server side and multiplayer logic in future.
